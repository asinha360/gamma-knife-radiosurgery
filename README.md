# Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Simulations

This project follows the simulation of a Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment of a small metastatic brain tumour. All work for this project has been done for CISC 330 - Computer Integrated Surgery hosted by Dr. Gabor Fichtinger.

Here are some interesting facts about Gamma Knife:

- Non-invasive
- Uses precisely focused beams of high dose gamma radiation
- Targets small to medium sized lesions
- Minimal damage to surrounding tissue and short recovery time

This project follows the creation of a 3D surgical suite which we use to locate the tumour, figure out its epicenter to concentrate dose delivery while minimizing dosage on non-malign tissue.
